# MVC101 Repository - Learning and Exploring MVC Basics

👋 Welcome to the MVC101 repository! Here, I am on a thrilling journey of learning the fundamentals of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and its applications, like the **MovieApp**. 🎬🎥

## 📝 About the Project

The main focus of this repository is to dive into the world of MVC and grasp its concepts in depth. As I progress, I'll be working on the **MovieApp**, a simple web application that allows users to browse and explore their favorite movies. 🍿

## 🚧 Work in Progress

⚠️ **Note**: This project is still a work in progress. I am actively learning and dedicating time to enhance my understanding of MVC, refining the **MovieApp**, and experimenting with different aspects of web development. 📚🛠️

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Understand the MVC architecture and its role in web development.
- Learn how to create and manage models, views, and controllers effectively.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for movies in the **MovieApp**.
- Dive into routing, data binding, and other essential MVC concepts.
